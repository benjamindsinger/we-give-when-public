    <p style="font-style: italic;">Automatically donate every time:</p>

    <table class="all__the__examples">
      <tr>
        <td>Your opponent tweets</td>
        <td>A disaster needs a response</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Trump tweets (100/mo)</td>
        <td>Jeff Sessions tweets</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Trump lies (9/mo, Politifact)</td>
        <td>You get press</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Your opponent takes a corporate check</td>
        <td>You help someone in need</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You get 100 petition signatures</td>
        <td>You get a politician to sign on</td>
