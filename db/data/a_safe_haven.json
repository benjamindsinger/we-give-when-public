Your generous gift will help individuals, who may have lost their way, get back on the right path at A Safe Haven. Whether at the beginning, middle, or end of their journey, your gift will help people achieve sustainable independence with pride and purpose.",
        "These services cost $9,600 for the entire set of services including housing, education, and more. The $250 per job we secure will go a long way to fund our Workforce Development Department that develops relationships with employers and places our community members into immediately available jobs."
