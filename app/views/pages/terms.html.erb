  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <div class="what__its__about">
    <p>Our mission is to help you take on powerful forces by making fundraising sustainable, easy, and meaningful. For too long, causes and candidates have not communicated to donors how sustained giving is tied to ongoing threats or needs. Give When provides a way for donors to sustainably fund what they want to see in the world, by tying automatic giving to real-world threats, opportunities, and needs. We believe social change should be driven by the people--not the powerful, big money special interests who currently call the shots.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, you can email us at info@wegivewhen.com</p>
    <p>By using our website and services offered by wegivewhen.com, and/or by directing others to use services offered by Give When, you’re agreeing to these Terms of Service. You’re also agreeing to our Privacy Policy and any other rules on the site.</p>

    <h3>General Terms</h3>
    <p>Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to place you and Give When in the relationship of employer-employee, principal-agent, affiliates, partners or joint venturers.</p>
    <p>The invalidation of any portion of these Terms of Service shall not affect the validity of any other provisions.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Terms of Service Agreement</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Terms of Service at any time. We will make clear that changes have been made by indicating on the Terms of Service the date it was last updated. Unless otherwise stated in the amendment, the amended Terms of Service will automatically be effective seven days after it is initially posted on the site. We encourage you to review this Terms of Service from time to time to make sure that you understand how any Personal Information you provide will be used.</p>

    <h3>How Donating (Funding) Works</h3>
    <p>Donations are financial contributions from an individual to a campaign, organization, or candidate.</p>
    <p>We’ve partnered with Stripe, a leading payment processor. You can find out more here: https://stripe.com/</p>

    <h3>Our Fees</h3>
    <p>Unlike other donation platforms, when supporters make a donation through Give When, they cover the transaction fees to help organizations receive all of the original intended donation amount. To do this, we calculate the processing surcharge on top of your intended donation that goes to our payment processor, Stripe, and also the amount that goes to Give When, to help maintain, support, build, and improve our platform. Typically these fees come out of the intended donation, leading to fewer financial  resources that organizations have to run their campaigns. Now, with Give When, organizations still pay these costs to the payment processors (Stripe & Give When), but their supporters cover them. A couple dollars may not be very meaningful to one supporter, but multiplied by thousands of supporters, that adds up to a big cost savings for organizations. In this way, we help organizations and candidates make giving easy, meaningful, and pain-free for their supporters, while helping organizations and candidates raise more money.</p>

    <h3>Candidate information</h3>
    <p>In cases where our users want to donate to candidates on Give When, we act as a platform to connect the donor to the candidate. For purposes of campaign finance, donations made through Give When are direct donations from the donor to the candidate.</p>

    <p>We aim to have accurate and current information. If you spot any errors or omissions, please email us at info@wegivewhen.com.</p>

    <h3>Refund policy</h3>

    <p>If you’ve made a pledge and changed your mind about contributing to a candidate/organization, email us: support@wegivewhen.com with your full name and the pledge you would like to cancel.</p>

    <p>Donations can be refunded if you make a request. Let us know as soon as possible, email: support@wegivewhen.com with your full name, the name of the candidate/campaign you donated to and the last four digits of the card used to make the donation. If however, the funds have already been transferred to the recipient, you will need to contact the recipient directly to request a refund.</p>

    <h3>Termination</h3>
    You can stop using our services at any time and end your agreement with us without charge. For both users and campaign or community creators, please email us at support@wegivewhen.com and request to cancel your accounts.

    <h3>F. Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action Rights</h3>

Arbitration replaces the right to appear in court, and each party also agrees to waive any right that it might have to a jury trial or the opportunity to litigate any Claims in court before a judge or jury. Either Creator or Company may require the submission of a Claim to binding arbitration at any reasonable time notwithstanding that a lawsuit or other proceeding has been commenced.</li>
    <li>2) Neither Creator nor Company will be entitled to join or consolidate Claims by or against the other in any arbitration, or to include in any arbitration any Claim as a representative or member of a class, or to act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a private attorney general capacity.</li>

The arbitrator must be a lawyer actively engaged in the practice of law or a retired judge, and must have relevant expertise.</li>
    <li>4) The arbitrator shall not have authority to vary the terms or conditions of this Agreement. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on the parties, except that either party may seek judicial relief for any alleged failure by the arbitrator to comply with the preceding sentence, and either party may also seek judicial relief to enforce an award if necessary.</li>
    <li>5) This section F does not prevent Creator or Company from exercising any lawful rights to other self-help remedies, such as setoff rights.</li>
    <li>6) Creator and Company each shall take all steps and execute all documents necessary for the implementation of arbitration proceedings. Neither the parties nor the arbitrator may disclose the content or results of any such arbitration, except as required by court order or applicable law, rule or regulation. The parties shall share equally the costs assessed by the AAA or the arbitrator and other joint costs of the arbitration, but each party shall bear its own attorneys’ and experts’ fees and other costs incurred that are solely attributable to that party’s decision and actions.</li>
    <li>7) Subject to the foregoing, Creator agrees that exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute, claim or controversy between Creator and Company arising from or in connection with this Agreement or Creator’s use of any Campaign, Community or the Site and all related matters shall be in the federal and state courts located in Delaware, U.S.A.</li>
